<p>#Teamfight Tactics</p>
<!-- toc -->
<p>Teamfight tactics is an auto battler game. You play as a “tiny titan” who builds a team of champions to fight on their bidding in a round robin against 7 other players. Each time you lose a battle your titan takes some damage until eventually you are eliminated. If you are the last titan standing then you win the round.</p>
<p>Central building an army are synergies. All of the champions you can choose from have two or three “traits”. Putting champions that share a trait together will give you a bonus. Some traits require only a single champion to become active, while others activate at 2 or 3.</p>
